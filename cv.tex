With an IAESTE internship I travelled to China to work with MT. This provided a unique opportunity to learn about a new country internally, especially the work norms. I completed the Customise Form Module project which allowed users to customise the layout of their HGV scale terminals. The technologies used were Windows Forms, C\#, XML and SQL. In addition to the technical side, I also helped the native staff improve their English and taught about western culture and Scotland. I worked on a HR project to improve the quality of staff meetings and was involved in many cultural exchange activities.

     {Summer Intern}

I worked for the Public Services, PS, department for IS \& GS LM and completed work in two projects. One system that was already live and needed accessibility tweaks for screen readers and one system the company was taking over and I created unit tests and heavily refactored in preparation for the switch, using C\# and .NET. In addition, I used NHibernate, an object relational mapper for mapping domain models to relational databases, and Rhinomocks, a dynamic mock object framework.
